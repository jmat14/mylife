<H1> Early Life </H1>
<p> I was born and raised in Rockland Maine where I have lived all my life. My parents 
are Tim and Angie Matero. I have 2 older brothers named Aaron and Ryan. As a child, my 
parents described me as a "wild child". Putting spaghetti on my head and causing mischief.
My father was a professional bowler and as a child he introduced me to candlepin bowling.
We would go to the bowling alley at least twice a week were he would teach me the proper
form.
