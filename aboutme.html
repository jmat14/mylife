<H1> More about me </H1>
<body> I am currently 20 years old and I like to travel, I don't do it as much as I wish I
could but when I graduate I would like to explore the world. My most recent trip was to 
Vegas, unfortunately I couldn't really experience Vegas the way most do (I am under 21 
therefore I couldn't gamble or drink) but I still had a great time regardless. Throughout 
my young life I have had 2 jobs, I have worked as a camp counselor for a YMCA summer camp
and I have also worked at the Samoset Resort in Rockport Maine. Working at the Samoset was 
cool because I got to meet many celebrities such as Seth Rogan, Gary Bettman (NHL 
commissioner), Spose (rapper), as well as John Travolta.
