<H1> College </H1>
<body> My college career is kinda funky. I attended the University of Southern Maine for 
my first 2 years in college. I was studying tourism and hospitality because I had an 
interest in the field. I made the decision to transfer to UMaine after my sophomore year 
because I was looking for a better education as well as experience real college life. I am 
happy I made the decision to transfer because I am enjoying myself here as well as 
receiving an excellent education. I am now a majoring business and looking to minor in 
marketing.
