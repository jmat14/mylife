<Body> I attended Oceanside High School- East in Rockland, Maine. I was fairly involved in
high school, attending fundraisers, playing sports, and even helping with productions in
theater. I played baseball and basketball throughout high school. I only played baseball 
my freshman and sophomore year where as I played basketball all 4 years. I graduated high 
school in 2015 with an 87 average.
